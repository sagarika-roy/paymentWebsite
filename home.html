            <h2>Journey</h2>
            <p>journey of hopes begins with failures </p>
            <p> recreation of one's thought lies in the path of hope </p>
            <p> the road  which  bounded by fulls of ups and downs</p>
            <P>the road which breaks the power for  recreation of thought</P>
            <p>the way of  hopes takes in the route to loneliness </p> 
            <p> where all around lies only the screeching sound reminding his failures</p>
            <p>but this is the path where one can generate one's self </p>
            <p> the urge to live a constant inspirational life lies in the way of new hopes in this desolated world</p>

            <h2>Stars on my mind</h2>
             <p> It is three at night,  trying my best to sleep, but my mind is somewhere away from sleep, and this gust of wind peeking through my open window makes my mind up to go up and enjoy the rusty feeling of the night. I get to my terrace on tiptoeing, clear night along with the bise calms me. There is always something secretive about the night; the presence of stars makes the night mysterious and heavenly beautiful. Ancient people always said that the more beautiful element of the night are the stars; the stars are the trinket of the night ''the glistening dome'', the source of luminous night. Ancestors also said that after death soul became a star. It is estimated that; there are two trillion or two billion galaxies in the universe, among which The Milky way, is just one of a mere 100 billion galaxies in the universe made of four hundred billion stars along with dead stars which had already completed their life cycle and also the interstellar medium(ISM), The ISM is the space between the stars, it is the birthplace of a star indeed;</p>
             <p>I just literally lost myself under the stars, grieving to visit those deity's art in nature or of nature; every time I look high,  my soul every time feels bliss. </p>
             <p>long through the wood </p>
             <p> free from the unbiased world</p>
             <p>under the light of thousands of stars</p>
             <p>thousands of thousands of meters high</p>
             <p>depict the peace of night</p>
             <p>glistening like  lost ones</p>
             <p>brightening all along in the dome-like sky</p>
             <p>Albeit, thousands of millions of far</p>
             <p>But blossoming the whole world with their luminous power,</p>
